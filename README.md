ios-class
=========

I'm participating in "CODING TOGETHER: Apps for iPhone & iPad" on piazza.com
this summer, but I've decided to do the class exercises in RubyMotion instead.

RubyMotion is a commercial development environment that allows you to write
iOS-based apps in a dialect of Ruby. Ruby is very expressive, and has a rich
tradition of test-first development. For more information, see
www.rubymotion.com.

Because RubyMotion does not have direct integration with Xcode's Interface
Builder, there is a parallel Xcode-based UI shell for each project. I first
build the needed UI in Xcode, using a dummy Objective C project. After editing
the storyboard using Xcode, I copy the storyboard file into the RubyMotion
project's resources folder.
