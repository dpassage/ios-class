ios-class
=========

I'm participating in "CODING TOGETHER: Apps for iPhone & iPad" on
piazza.com this summer, but I've decided to to the class exercises
in RubyMotion instead.

RubyMotion is a commercial development environment which allows you
to write iOS-based apps in a dialect of Ruby. Ruby is very expressive,
and has a rich tradition of test-first development. For more information,
see www.rubymotion.com.

Because RubyMotion does not have direct integration with Xcode's Interface
Builder, there is a parallel Xcode-based UI shell for each project. After
editing the storyboard using Xcode, I copy it into the RubyMotion project's
resources folder.
